# React + Vite

This is my personal portfolio for my work - both coding and artwork!

<h1>The Goal</h1>
I want to build a functional personal website. Id like to be able to recieve emails from the contact section of the website. Id like to showcase my artwork and my code in a clean way without sacrificing my personal spirit. I would like to utilize a more neobrutalist approach to my website because I really like that style. I also want to add more CSS animations! Id like to have some delays with the load in of some elements to create some visual disruption which i think would be nice. The more difficult part I feel is the contact form. I am going to try to use Emailjs to hook up my email to the contact form. 


<h1>The Process</h1>
I started with the file structure. I like for each component to have its own CSS file, inside its own folder. Seperating the CSS like this makes it easier for me to see where my mistakes are, where the structuring needs to happen/ is happening, and helps me with responsive design as well. This website wasnt going to be extremely robust or complicated so the actual process after the file system was created was very straight forward. Decide between flexbox or grid, add information and images, and move on. I got all the way down to the contact form and then I do a second pass from top to bottom and this is when I add more specific styling like the neobrutalist features. The third pass is for very specific things like delays and hovers and whatever other animations I want to add. In any other project, the very first thing id do is create the functionality and make sure it works before I start styling but because so much of this project was just regular information on a screen, I waited until the end to create the form. 


<h1>What I Learned</h1>
I learned about EmailJs for the contact form. I knew having a form where you put in your information as a visitor didnt really make too much sense since the visitor is contacting me - im not contacting the visitor. The implementation was relatively straight forward but like anything that is straight forward - it did not work. 


<h1>What Can Be Improved?</h1>
I think the UI of the Hero component can be improved. I have always struggled with the 'wam' factor of the landing page and im still struggling with it. I dont know how little is too little and how much is too much. I added some of my art but I felt the 'vibe' was off. It not longer was clean and sleek which is the feeling i wanted to put forward. I also want to see where I cn add some visual interest. I love the github landing page. Im going to take a lot of inspiration from tht page moving forward. The delays when scrolling down, the way the cards shift around, the lines and gradients, I love it so im going to be using that moving forward.


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
